# Task 2 - Linear regression: Dataset creation and Parameter initialization

**Description**

We want to create and train a machine learning model that given `x` predicts `2 * x`.

Create the following functions:

1. `create_dataset`: accepts `n` and returns `n` consecutive samples that demonstrate the expected behavior.
2. `initialize_weights`: accepts `x` and `y` and returns a random number in the range [x, y).

**Acceptance criteria**

1. A Python file is used for the solution.
2. A general form of the model is placed in a comment that shows how many parameters the model has.
3. `numpy` is used to initialize the parameter(s) of the model.

**Test case**

```python
create_dataset(4)          # [(0, 0), (1, 2), (2, 4), (3, 6), (4, 8)]
initialize_weights(0, 100) # 95.07143064099162
initialize_weights(0, 10)  # 3.745401188473625
```

# Task 3 - Linear regression: Measure how bad the model is

**Description**

We want to create and train a machine learning model that given `x` predicts `2 * x`.

Create a dataset with 5 samples.
Create a model that has a random value for its parameter in the interval [0, 10) with a seed set to `42`.

Create a function `calculate_loss` that accepts the model, a dataset and computes the mean squared error of the model over the dataset.

**Acceptance criteria**

1. The above functionality is implemented.
2. Experiment with the first parameter of the model - what happens to loss function when you pass `w + 0.001 * 2`, `w + 0.001`, `w - 0.001` and `w - 0.001 * 2`?

**Test case**

```python
loss = calculate_loss(w, dataset)
<print the loss> # MSE: 27.92556532998047
```

# Task 4 - Linear regression: Learning rate and finite differences

**Description**

We want to automatically update the value of the parameter using the method of finite differences to approximate the derivative. Approximate the derivative and subtract the resulting value from the parameter.

**Acceptance criteria**

1. The above functionality is implemented.
2. Print the value of the loss function before updating the parameter.
3. Print the value of the loss function after updating the parameter.
4. See how adding a `learning rate` impacts the value of the loss function.
5. Include a `for-loop` in which the process is repeated `10` times (also known as `epochs` - the number of times the whole dataset is traversed).

**Test cases**

```python
approximate_derivative = <calculation>
print(calculate_loss(w, dataset))
w -= approximate_derivative
print(calculate_loss(w, dataset))
```

compare it with

```python
learning_rate = 0.001
approximate_derivative = <calculation>
print(calculate_loss(w, dataset))
w -= learning_rate * approximate_derivative
print(calculate_loss(w, dataset))
```

# Task 5 - Training the model

**Description**

Train the model for `500 epochs` and print the value of `w`.

Experiment with removing the `seed` and seeing whether the training still converges.

Congratulations! You just created and trained your first neural network ðŸŽ‰!

**Acceptance criteria**

1. The above functionality is implemented.

**Acceptance criteria**

1. Real output matches expected output.

## Task 4

Solve all tasks from `numpy_for_home.ipynb`.

**Acceptance criteria**

1. Real output matches expected output on tasks that do not include working with random numbers.

## Task 5

**Description**

In class we created a neural network with one neuron that had one input. In this task we're going to model the `AND` and `OR` circuit operations, thus the network is going to have two inputs and thus two weights attached to them. Create two models and train for 1,000 epochs and after each epoch print the values for the parameters of the models and the value of the loss function. When the two models are trained, apply each of them to their corresponding training sets and print the values they predict.

**Acceptance criteria**

1. A general form of the two models is placed in a comment that shows how many parameters they have.
2. A dataset of tuples with three elements is created for the `OR` gate.
3. A dataset of tuples with three elements is created for the `AND` gate.
4. The loss function is modified accordingly.
5. Weights are initialized randomly without seed.
6. The loss function decreases as more epochs are done.
7. The two models are trained for 1,000 epochs.
8. Print the values the models predict. What do you notice about them?

## Task 6

**Description**

Extend the functionality of task 5 by adding a free-floating parameter (i.e. a parameter that has a weight of `1`) - the `bias`. This would help the model drive the loss down to 0. Out models will now have three parameters, though, note that the `bias` is a parameter of the model itself, it's not part of the dataset.

The `bias` parameter allows the model to shift it's prediction when all of its weights become 0.

**Acceptance criteria**

1. A general form of the two models is placed in a comment that shows how many parameters they have.
2. Print the values the models predict. What has changed in comparison to task 5?
