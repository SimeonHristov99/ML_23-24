# Machine Learning and Data Mining, Summer 2023-2024

## Set up an environment for working with Jupyter Notebooks

Please follow the instructions in one of the following two folders:

1. [GuideForVisualStudioCode](./GuideForVisualStudioCode/) - for working in a local development environment (recommended by Simo)
2. [GuideForGoogleColab](./GuideForGoogleColab/) - for working using a remote Google Cloud session.

## Most Important APIs

- [Python](https://docs.python.org/3.10/tutorial/index.html)
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/index.html)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/index)
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
- [Scikit learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html)
- [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)

## Learning Data Science and Machine Learning

1. Programming. Learn Python.
2. Learn basic Statistics by taking the crash course recommended by me.
3. Learn SQL. Check out [mode.com](https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/).
4. Exploratory Data Analysis. Learn how to work with NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
5. Machine Learning. Learn the various algorithms. Explore Scikit-learn.
6. Data scraping. Explore the [Beautiful soup](https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library.
7. Study the niches: deep learning, nlp (natural language processing), cv (computer vision).
8. Deployment. Explore Flask, Streamlit, Django.

### Framework

1. Learn just enough.
2. Do a project. For example choose one from Kaggle.
3. Accountability. Show off your work on Github.
4. Repeat.
